#Blog Stuff

This is the source code for the blog i'm producing. The point of the blog will be to show the projects I'm working on. 
It should consist of kaggle compition stuff, random projects, maybe some life events.

I will also be trying to host this blog on a raspberry pi running an apache server. We'll see how that goes.

pls don't hack
